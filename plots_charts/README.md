## Plots and Charts folder
### Author: Andres Machado

This folder houses the `.png` files for all the charts on the principal README file. Below is a short description
of all of the files in this folder:

- **final_models_results.png**: Displays recall, precision, and F1‐score metrics for SMOTE‐tuned Voting Classifier, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Naive Bayes models.  
- **smote_results_before_after.png**: Compares F1‐scores before and after applying SMOTE for hypertuned Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM.  
- **grouped_bar_scholarship.png**: Shows a grouped bar chart of Dropout, Enrolled, and Graduate proportions by scholarship holder status.  
- **grouped_bar_tuition_fees.png**: Illustrates a grouped bar chart of outcome proportions based on whether tuition fees are up to date.  
- **violin_plots.png**: Presents violin plots of age at enrollment and first-semester credited units across target outcome categories.  
- **pie_target_proportions.png**: Pie chart showing the relative frequencies of Graduate, Dropout, and Enrolled classes.  
- **prelim_model_results.png**: Table of average precision, recall, and F1‐scores for preliminary classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Perceptron, and SVM).
